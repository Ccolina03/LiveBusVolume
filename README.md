# Smart Transit Real-Time Analytics

A cutting-edge platform that repurposes existing hardware—from agency, city, and government cameras—to deliver real-time public transit analytics. Our solution leverages privacy-preserving object detection to count passengers (without recording personal identities) and processes these counts via a distributed pipeline. Imagine a city like Edmonton tracking bus ridership across 900+ buses in real time to optimize transit operations and resource allocation.

## Overview

Smart Transit Real-Time Analytics transforms existing camera infrastructure into a powerful tool for modern urban management. By implementing state-of-the-art machine learning models for object detection (focused solely on counting objects to maintain privacy), we provide actionable insights through a fully distributed, real-time pipeline. Our system empowers cities and transit agencies to:

- **Optimize Resources:** Deploy more buses in high-demand areas.
- **Improve Traffic Strategies:** Develop data-driven strategies for smoother traffic flow.
- **Enhance Emergency Response:** Monitor passenger volumes to trigger timely alerts and updates.

## Optimization Strategies

To further enhance real-time analytics and improve decision-making, our platform incorporates several optimization techniques:

### **1. WebSocket Subscription for Real-Time Updates**  
- Instead of relying solely on periodic API polling, the frontend subscribes to an **Apache Kafka topic via a WebSocket connection**.  
- This ensures that updates on passenger counts, bus occupancy, and traffic conditions are **instantly pushed** to the dashboard, reducing latency and improving responsiveness.

### **2. Display Anonymized Images for Contextual Insights**  
- To provide **visual verification** without compromising privacy, the system can display **blurred, anonymized images** next to live dashboard analytics.  
- This feature allows transit agencies to **validate passenger counts** and identify **potential operational issues**, such as overcrowding or improper seating distribution.  
- The anonymization ensures compliance with data privacy laws while **enhancing situational awareness**.

### **3. Live Bus Tracking with Data Overlay**  
- **GPS integration** allows for real-time tracking of each bus, displaying its exact location on a city map.  
- Overlaying **real-time passenger load** on each tracked vehicle enables better routing and **adaptive scheduling**, ensuring optimized resource allocation.

### **4. Spatial Fragmentation Analysis for Improved Bus Utilization**  
- Instead of treating the entire bus as a single occupancy metric, our system applies **spatial fragmentation** by segmenting the vehicle into multiple sections (e.g., front, middle, back).  
- Each section’s occupancy is analyzed separately, allowing for:
  - Identification of **underutilized spaces** within the bus.
  - Adjustments to **seating arrangements** for better passenger distribution.
  - Recommendations for **dynamic bus design** optimizations based on usage patterns.
  
### **5. Government & Policy Recommendations**  
- The insights generated from **spatial fragmentation, real-time occupancy, and traffic flow data** provide governments with the ability to:
  - Develop **better public transportation policies**.
  - Implement **targeted infrastructure improvements**.
  - Justify budget allocations for **fleet expansion or reallocation**.
  - Introduce **incentive programs** to distribute passenger load across different hours or routes.


- **Visualization:**  
  Access the dashboard to view live analytics, monitor transit volume, and derive actionable insights.

- **Example Use-Case:**  
  A city transit department can analyze peak bus occupancy times and reallocate vehicles accordingly.
